This course included the standard introductory college algebra topics including:


Linear Equations
======
 * The standard analysis of $$y = mx + b$$.

Functions
======
 * A discussion of relations, branching off of $$y = mx + b$$.
 * A discussion of functions as a special type of relation.
 * A discussion of function composition and function inverses.

Quadratic Functions
======
 * A discussion of functions of the form $f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c$ for $a \neq 0$.
 * The vertex form of a quadratic, and how to go between vertex form and standard form.
 * The quadratic equation.
 * A discussion about how to describe geometric things like roots, vertices, and opening up or down using purely algebra.

Polynomial Functions
======
 * A discussion of functions of the form $f(x) = a_{n}x^n + \cdots + a_{0}$.
 * A discussion of the fundamental theorem of algebra. 
 * A discussion of polynomial geometry, and using algebra to describe the geometric notions concretely.

Exponential and Logarithmic Functions
======
 * A discussion of functions of the form $f(x) = ca^x$ for $a \neq 0$ and their inverses, $f^{-1}(x) = \log_{a} (x)$
 * A discussion of compound interest.
 * A discussion of $e$ and the natural logarithm.

Linear Systems
======
 * A basic discussion of solving systems of linear equations.
 * Setting up and solving 2x2 systems of equations. 
 * Inverse matrices.

Counting and Probability
======
 * A discussion of the addition principle, the multiplication principle, factorials, combinations, and permutations.
 * Applying basic counting to basic probability problems, such as predicting odds of drawing various hands in poker.
