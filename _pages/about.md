Hello and welcome! This website contains what I've done and been doing. I'm a mathematician who works as a linux system administrator and talk about those things from time to time. I have a list of things I'm learning/have learned at the bottom of my CV. Ideally that'll be growing all the time. You can get into contact with me via my email on the right.
